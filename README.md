About The Project

This tool is designed to answer a common question for aspiring gardeners: "Is it actually cheaper to grow my own herbs?"

Unlike simple calculators, this app accounts for the entire lifecycle of the plant‚Äîfrom the initial waiting period for the first harvest to the ongoing yield and regrowth cycles. This provides a much more accurate break-even point and a realistic savings analysis over the course of a year.

‚ú® Features

Realistic Growth Simulation: Accounts for time to first harvest, yield per harvest, and regrowth periods for different herbs.

Dynamic Calculations: Instantly updates costs and savings based on your inputs.

International Support: Pre-filled data for multiple countries and currencies (USD, GBP, EUR, INR, CAD, AUD).

Interactive Data Visualization: Uses Chart.js to display a clear, month-by-month breakdown of your cumulative savings.

Sleek & Responsive UI: Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, mobile-friendly experience on any device.

Customizable Inputs: Provides smart defaults but allows users to override all values for a personalized calculation.
